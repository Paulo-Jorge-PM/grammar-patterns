# Cloud Rain #

This is a software I made for a research group on psychology,that was studying grammar patterns learning skills in children. Tt was used to collect data and test children learning skills. It started as a test concept only and I had not time to make it clean, so the code is a little messy. Initially it was interactive, one could move the could with the mouse and click, and had a lot of extra stuff (f.e. the soild sprites were randoom, changing each time the app was run; when rain touched the tree flowers would appear on screen and happy sounds, like a status bar, when reached 100% it would feel all the screen; there were extra aniamtions and souds, etc.). Later they asked me to make it statick and cut all the fancy visuals, because children would be distracted by it: now after x seconds the steps on screen change automatically and voices give the comands for the test (a male and a female dpending on the user gender). When the app runs, it asks if one want to use the fixed version (1) or the interactive one (2), but only the 1st works fine, the 2nd one was the initall interactive one with animations cutted out, but I stoped developing it and now it crashs in some points.


To run execute the file "main.py": you need to have Python 2.7 installed and a version of Pyglet (just do "pip install pyglet" in the command line to get it).
Or if you don't have Python run the file "main.exe": it is a compiled version made with pyinstall.
